upon player join, a 'fingerprint' object is created and added to 'fingerprintPool'.
upon player leave, their corresponding fingerprint is removed from the pool (pool len should always be 1:1 with current online players)



'fingerprint' obj schema:
    UUID uuid - account UUID
    String name - account IGN
    IP ip - player ip
    Datetime startTime - datetime at obj initialisation (player join)
    Datetime endTime - datetime when fingerprint is resolved (player leave) (empty until then)


data points to track ideas:
- IP address
- average ping
- settings packet (volume sliders etc.)
- forge mod lists (FML server-side)
- ^^above but for any other mods that offer data/request custom rules (lunar, badlion, labymod etc.)
- average online times (find potential timezone ranges) (compare overlap with others (potential alts))
- long shot: average modality or sentence complexity from chat messages/whispers (over a long period)
- value ip-uniqueness if not resolved as possible VPN ip
- potentially determine mouse polling rate and/or sensitivity based off of average variation in rotations
- hotbar slot changes (scrolling vs binds)
